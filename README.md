# FinanceApp

##
This code is calculating the financial analysis of a set of data. The data is an array containing months and the associated financial value for that month. The code first sets up variables to store the total, average, change, net, and netArray. It also sets up two arrays to store the greatest and least values. 

The code then loops through the array to calculate the total, change, net, and netArray values. It also checks for the greatest and least values in each loop iteration. 

After looping through all of the array elements, it calculates the average by summing up all of the elements in netArray and dividing by 86 (the number of elements). 

Finally it prints out a string containing all of the analysis information to console log.
